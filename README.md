# js-dom

This is a challenge from [this MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents#active_learning_a_dynamic_shopping_list) to test my DOM skills.

In this challenge, we are asked to make a simple shopping list example that allows the user to dynamically add items to the list using a form input and button.

When an item is added to the input and press the button:

- The item should appear in the list.
- Each item should be given a button that can be pressed to delete that item off the list.
- The input should be emptied and focused ready for you to enter another item.

Please note that all the javascript codes are included in the script tag at the bottom of the html file.
